This is a very simple EG GUI.  It's built on JointJS.

Specifically, it's from the following example tutorial on expanding parent areas:

Alright, I think the process for getting VS Code to work with Github is as follows:
1. Setup GitHub account (this should already be done).
2. Setup GitHub Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/)
   - I had fooled around with manually configuring git before I downloaded
     this.  I'm not sure if that was necessary or not...
3. Use GitHub Desktop to clone our Existential-Graph-Editor repository 
   to a folder on your local computer.
4. Setup Microsoft VScode (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
5. Open the folder you cloned to the repository in VScode.
6. Profit.  It should detect that this is a Github repository and you 
   can start pulling and pushing updates from within VScode.
   (That's how this text was added to this file.)
   
   This is a test to show Telly.
